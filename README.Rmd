## wrftools

I'm not an expert in WRF but i need to use it. One of the very frustating and
tricky part was to make a correct namelist.wps. Hours and hours trying to
get the perfect domains. This functions solves this part while providing
a dynamic maps for actually viewing where are your domains. 

## System requirements
You need [sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf) and [mapview](https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview) from [r-spatial](https://github.com/r-spatial/). 


## Install
```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ibarraespinosa/wrftools")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(wrftools)
a <- wrf_domains()
a[[1]] # mapview
```
